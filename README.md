## Background

*To use our skills in JQuery and local storage,* we were instructed to create a daily scheduler that organizes each hour in the day. As the hours progress, the line items change from green (future time) to red (present hour) to grey (past time). Each hour has a section to enter a to-do list and then save it to local storage.

## Usage

This is being used as an assignment project, but could easily be used in real life for any kind of daily scheduler. A real life version might be better if it contained more features, like a weekly option.
